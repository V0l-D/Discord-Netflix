## 🐛 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by contacting a developer through our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kbf8EjpxbU).

We typically review and address reports within a few hours to a few days. If the issue stems from an external dependency (e.g., an npm package), we will update it as soon as possible.

Thank you for helping keep the project secure!
